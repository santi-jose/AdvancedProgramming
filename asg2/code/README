I am working alone, not doing pair programming.
All of the work submitted here is code written by me
(written by me: commands.cpp, file_sys.h, file_sys.cpp),
except for code copied from the instructor's directories.
I have read and understood the UC Santa Cruz
Academic Misconduct Policy for Undergraduates.
